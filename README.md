# Finder.io

**Problem Statement** : In this state of lockdown  most of the shops providing essential items are closed. Moreover travelling is a risky affair.  So we need to minimise the amount of travel and maximize our purchase. At the same time avoid the risk of contamination via delivery guys or parcels.

**What is finder.io?**

> Finder.io is basically an application currently developed for the web, which allows store-owners to store a record of their inventory online.We urge local stores to keep a minimal inventory record on our platform. This can be seen by our customers. The customer can sort on the basis of various metrics and choose the shop and go there to buy stuff.These metrics may include crowd, distance, risk of contamination and other things. Furthermore for revenue generation customers can pre book an item at a premium cost which allows the customer to go any time and pick his stuff up without the tension of stocks running out.
